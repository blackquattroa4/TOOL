TOOOL (Tracker Of Orders & Logistics) is a web-deliverable, cloud-based office information management system. It can help you track and manage orders (sales, purchase), accounting (payable/receivable), inventory, expense reporting, staff scheduling, business document, and much more.

TOOL is hosted on internet, so whether you have just one office location or many branch locations, or even with sales/executives on the road all the time, everyone in your organization can access business information any time, any where.
